An in game GUI tool based on [IL2CPP_Resolver](https://github.com/sneakyevil/IL2CPP_Resolver) made to modify il2cpp Unity games running on DX11; revisited version of my old [IL2CPP_Scanner_DX11](https://github.com/ImAxel0/IL2CPP_Scanner_DX11).

### What's new?
- gameobject transform tweaking and inspector window
- get children gameobjects
- methods calling (with some limitations)
- class field type
- more stable and easier to use (I think)
